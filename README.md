# amount_transaction_analysis
This Python script, avg_trans_amt.py, leverages the Pandas library to analyze transaction data and calculate the average transaction amount on a monthly basis. The code reads input from an Excel file, processes the data, and outputs a dictionary containing the average transaction amount for each month.
