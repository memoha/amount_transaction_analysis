# amount_transaction_analysis
This Python script, avg_trans_amt.py, leverages the Pandas library to analyze transaction data and calculate the average transaction amount on a monthly basis. The code reads input from an Excel file, processes the data, and outputs a dictionary containing the average transaction amount for each month.

Key Features:

Efficiently handles transaction data with Pandas DataFrames.
Organizes transaction amounts on a monthly basis for easy trend analysis.
Outputs a dictionary with monthly average transaction amounts.
Usage:

Input your transaction data in the provided Excel file (avg_trans_amt.xlsx).
Run the script to obtain a dictionary with monthly average transaction amounts.

Sample Output:
{'2024-01': 125.0, '2024-02': 225.0, '2024-03': 325.0}

Note:
Ensure that the Pandas library is installed in your Python environment (pip install pandas).

Motivation:
This project serves as a practical example of data analysis and manipulation, showcasing skills relevant to data science roles. The script can be adapted for various datasets and provides a foundation for further exploration and visualization.

Feel free to explore and adapt this code for your specific data analysis needs.
